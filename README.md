# Posture Checker

A simple programm for the arduino which performs a resistance check on three pins and publishes the results via BLE.
Can be connected with the [Posture Client](https://github.com/TheSlimvReal/posture-client).

The aim was to check stretch of a [Conductive Rubber Sheet](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5464) that was attached to the skin in order to detect e.g. the head being tilted to one side.
